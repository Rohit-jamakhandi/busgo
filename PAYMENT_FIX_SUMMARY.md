# Payment Integration Fix Summary

## Issue
The payment page was not showing UPI, Net Banking, and Credit/Debit Card options when users selected seats and proceeded to pay.

## Root Cause
The Stripe Payment Intent was not configured with the correct payment method types for Indian payments. By default, Stripe only enables card payments unless explicitly specified.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Environment Variables
- **File**: `.env`
- **Changes**: Added Stripe API keys (stored in `.env.vercel` file, not committed to GitHub)
  - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your Stripe publishable key
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe secret key

### 2. Backend Changes
- **File**: `routes/bookings.js`
- **Line**: 44-49
- **Change**: Added `payment_method_types` array to Stripe Payment Intent creation

```javascript
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount,
  currency: 'inr',
  payment_method_types: ['card', 'upi', 'netbanking'], // ‚úÖ Added this line
  metadata: { busId: bus._id.toString(), seats: seats.join(',') },
});
```

This explicitly tells Stripe to enable:
- **Card payments** (Credit/Debit cards)
- **UPI** (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.)
- **Net Banking** (All major Indian banks)

### 3. Frontend Changes
- **File**: `views/booking.ejs`

#### Change 1: Simplified Payment UI (Lines 96-107)
- Removed redundant payment method selection buttons
- Removed QR code generation UI (Stripe handles UPI natively)
- Kept only the Stripe Payment Element which now shows all payment methods

#### Change 2: Enhanced Payment Element Configuration (Lines 343-348)
```javascript
const paymentElement = elements.create('payment', {
  layout: {
    type: 'tabs',
    defaultCollapsed: false,
  }
});
```

This configures the Payment Element to display payment methods as tabs, making it easier for users to switch between Card, UPI, and Net Banking.

#### Change 3: Simplified JavaScript Logic
- Removed QR payment initialization code
- Removed payment method switching logic
- Streamlined the payment flow to use only Stripe's native payment handling

## How It Works Now

1. **User selects seats** ‚Üí Clicks "Proceed to Pay"
2. **System initializes Stripe Payment Intent** with all Indian payment methods enabled
3. **Stripe Payment Element displays** with three tabs:
   - üí≥ **Card** - For credit/debit card payments
   - üì± **UPI** - For UPI payments (Google Pay, PhonePe, etc.)
   - üè¶ **Net Banking** - For direct bank transfers
4. **User selects preferred method** and completes payment
5. **Payment is verified** and booking is confirmed

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Test the payment flow**:
   - Login or create an account
   - Search for buses
   - Select a bus and choose seats
   - Click "Proceed to Pay"
   - You should now see all three payment options (Card, UPI, Net Banking)

4. **Use Stripe test cards** for testing:
   - **Success**: `4000003560000008` (Indian card)
   - **UPI Success**: Use test UPI ID in the UPI tab
   - **Requires authentication**: `4000002500003155`

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Test Mode**: Your keys are in test mode (`pk_test_...` and `sk_test_...`), so:
- No real money will be charged
- Use Stripe test payment methods only
- Real payment methods will be declined

‚úÖ **Production Ready**: When you're ready to go live:
1. Replace test keys with live keys from Stripe Dashboard
2. Complete Stripe account verification
3. Enable your preferred payment methods in Stripe Dashboard

## Verification Checklist

- ‚úÖ Stripe keys configured in `.env`
- ‚úÖ Payment Intent includes Indian payment methods
- ‚úÖ Payment Element configured with tabs layout
- ‚úÖ Simplified UI without redundant controls
- ‚úÖ Server running successfully on port 3000

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check the server logs for backend errors
3. Verify your Stripe keys are correct
4. Ensure your Stripe account has Indian payment methods enabled
